        <p class="text-left content-project">I worked full time as product designer for kelisto.es. kelisto is was price comparators for insurances, energy, finance and communication. Each of those area was a specific product including its own vertical subproducts. I have been working on 8 products in total. Alongside the comparators was a solid news platforms and a community of users designed for traffic generation and retention. I joined the project in the very early design phases and accepted the challenge of designing multiple and various products in a short spare of time. </p>

        <h3 class="project-title padding10_top">Strategy for multiple product launch</h3>
        <p class="text-left content-project">It is always difficult for me to answer when I am asked to describe my design process. The overall phases I follow are the same in most projects but evil is in the detail. In Kelisto I have been the only designer within multiple business and dev team members for more than one year during the most critical moment : official launch. I have learnt to adapt my process to this very specific context and people. I knew it was not going to be easy so I did my best to make it work as good as I could. </p>

        <h3 class="project-title padding10_top">Design Process</h3>
        <h4 class="project-title padding5_top">1/ research and kpi's</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">Just before landing in the price comparator business, I finalized a conversion-increase project for a retail ecommerce website in London. Price comparision was way more complex but I somehow felt challenged by the huge scope of this project. For every product I designed in kelisto, the very first step was to sit with the product manager in order to understand the purpose of the product and how success will be measured. I basically learnt to ask the correct questions :
            </p>
            <ul class="no_bullet">
        <li class="checked">What’s the story of how this product got to this point?</li>
<li class="checked">What are upcoming goals and risks for this product?</li>
<li class="checked">What information or element will be the top priority in your product?</li>
<li class="checked">Who are your target users? Why?</li>
<li class="checked twolines">How will we measure performance and success of this product? What are the kpi's of this product?</li>
<li class="checked twolines">What are the closest competitors to Kelisto? What would be your strategy ?</li>
</ul>


    <h6 class="project-title padding5_top">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
    proto-persona, field studies (for existing products), benchmarking, surveys, data mining and analytics
    <img class="padding10_top" src="app/kelisto/images/case_kelisto_3_energy.jpg" alt="kelisto energy case study">
        <h4 class="project-title padding10_top">2/ information architecture</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">During this phase I explored and assess multiple solutions. Alongside with the product manager we decided on new directions and opportunities. Most of the time our goal was to offer our users a process similar to most of the competitor and try to identify one killer feature to prioritize. After a couple of session working on wireframes I eventually started to code early a potential prototype. I liked to start coding as soon as possible because it is way easier to make decision with a product in context and I would also save time in development (I was in charge of implementing the solution). One of my priority was to get the copy as soon as possible, it is not as easy as it seems. Working on a prototype will make this first priority.</p>
        <p class="text-left content-project">
         Once we agreed on the beta version with business stakeholders, we started to prioritize and plan features development with the engineers (yes, dev stories). the prototype allowed us to discuss technical feasibility, which third party frameworks to use, what types of animations were possible... At this point, we usually iterate again including technical contraints in our plans and adjusting the prototype.

        </p>
        <h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Inputs</h6>
     content, copy, customer journey map, wireframes or, ideally coded prototype without design. Features priorization matrix.

        <h4 class="project-title padding10_top">3/ Visual Design</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">Having the features priorized and planned gave me the opportunity to spend more time working on the prototype. Prototyping present your work in a more dynamic and iterative way. Once I finalized a realistic version of the prototype I liked to run some usability testing with friends, colleagues or directly running guerrilla testing. At this time more iteration are required with business stakeholders and engineers but we were getting closer to whatthe final product would be. In this phase I usually worked thinking in what will come next : development and the hand-over of the prototype to the dev team. I therefore tried to be as specific as possible with the design requirement so the development hand-over would be smooth and straightforward.</p>

        <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Designing for a data-heavy products</h5>
        <p class="text-left content-project">The products we designed for Insurances, Energy or Communications involved a lot of information to be displayed to the users. To do so I had to consider and implement basic design principles for every single page :</p>

            <ul class="no_bullet">
                <li class="checked">Visual Hierarchy, repetition and pattern breaking</li>
                <li class="checked">Data-visualisation</li>
                <li class="checked">Responsive-ness</li>
                <li class="checked">Hick’s law</li>
                <li class="checked">Getstalt principles</li>
                <li class="checked">Affordance</li>
                <li class="checked">IxD</li>
                <li class="checked">Copy</li>
        </ul>

        <h6 class="project-title padding5_top">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
        high fidelity prototype.
        <h4 class="project-title padding10_top">4/ Development</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">Getting to work. I always liked to work closely with engineers. They have blunt statements about the product. Their inputs are always valuable.</p>

        <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Breaking the classic design waterfall process</h5>

        <p class="text-left content-project">I did my best to integrate design in agile methodology by getting to code as early as possible. Static designs waterfall makes less and less sense in this multi-devices age. I still use static Sketch design to solve specific problems but I definitely like to code as soon as possible. 
        Once the final prototype was approved I started to implement it with a back end developer. In the case of having a back-end developer working on both front and back development I provided as much information as possible with regards to design specs. At this point, iteration was still necessary for small details. I learnt to share design feedback early and often with engineers and stakeholders. I also allocated some time to do front-end work as well in order to make sure the product was fully responsive, accessible and compatible with all the browsers.
        </p>

        <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">styleguide and constant documentation</h5>
        <p class="text-left content-project">
            For the constantly growing products range, I considered how we could potentialy help engineers with design tasks and save time when shippping product to production. We needed to think about enabling engineers to continue scaling the design on their own. I started to design a styleguide that would become later a design system. I also tried to document as much as possible the rationalization of design decisions or data inputs. We tend to forget the steps we followed when designing and monitoring a product.

        <h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
     Integration in Rails environment, github, css3 Sass, compass, susy grids, coffeescript, code refactoring, performance reports, accessibility reports, web-mobile browsers compatibility testing validation with browserstack, early usability testing
        <h4 class="project-title padding10_top">5/ Testing & Iteration</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">Front-end testing for compatibility was the last step of the development phase. Once the product passed all our tests in the testing environment we shipped it to production. It was just the beggining of a new phase : the post go-live iteration. At this point we run more guerilla testing, getting feedback from everyone : customer support, content team, sales, users... </p>
            <p class="text-left content-project">
        We then priorized changes or features that popped-up during the development phase or the testing. Monitoring conversions with product manager allowed us to list some improvements to be implemented (visual design, bugs, new features...). The list was prioritized by putting the easy tasks that result in quick wins at the top. </p>
        <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Guerilla testing / Field Studies</h5>
         <p class="text-left content-project">In order to gain insight on excisting product about to be redesigned or brand new products, I run many interviews and testing sessions with final users. I basically asked each participant to complete a series of tasks while verbalizing their thoughts. I observed, took notes, then produced a consolidated document to be reviewed with the product managers. My goal was to validate some of the pain points I observed from testing the product myself.</p>

         <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Increasing conversion</h5>
         <p class="text-left content-project">Once the products were launched a new iteration phases started in order to make sure the conversion was optimal. To do so we validated assumptions by setting up a/b testing. </p>
        <h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Selling ux enhancement to stakeholders</h5>
         <p class="text-left content-project">
             
             How to deal with UX design as polish on a finished product?</p>

        <p class="text-left content-project">It makes integrating UX design into the lean/agile process very difficult, but it's a pretty common situation most designers have to face. How to deal with it ? Communication and metrics.  
         </p>
         <strong class="padding5_top">Communication</strong>
        <p class="text-left content-project">Communicating conceptual ideas, detailed designs, and design rationale both verbally and visually to exec team helped demystifying design process. To do so, I created a lab in order to sell ideas, always focusing on the value these new features would bring.</p>

        <strong>Bring the data</strong>

        <p class="text-left content-project">Following-up and iterate the design solutions you offer will also create trust with stackholders, showing that you also aim to generate more revenue, not just paint a shinny product. In this particular situation, being a UX designer with code skills made the process not easier but faster. The very first step of dealing with business stakeholders is to bring the data. Not only conversion but also converting UX to tangible metrics as much as I could.

        <h4 class="project-title padding10_top">Where did this process fail?</h4>
        <p class="text-left content-project">The scope of the project was so huge and despite the fact that an additional UX designer joined the team at some point I realized that the inputs for design changes from business stakeholders did not need as much rationalization as I needed to provide in order to improve current products. And terrible mistakes were made. We launched so many products in a short period of time that our engineers were sometimes left alone with the design. The styleguide needed to be turned into a design system which required much of a time I did not have. There were little room left for iteration (optimizing current products and fixing design mistakes I made). Design was somehow lost between huge business and back-end teams. If I were to start all over again (and I happily would!) I would make sure we take time to setup a consistent data-driven design system and process from the very beggining.</p>

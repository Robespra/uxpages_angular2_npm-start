        <p class="text-left content-project">
        Meka is a conversational bot oriented to creativity. It has been designed to identify and train creative profiles. Creative industries face an information gap on skills : there is little evidence on the skills required by creative talent. Based on our knowledge and the creative profiles we prepared for various domains, we aim to help companies in hiring creative profiles. Creativity is about connecting dots. When designing meka we decided to connect psychology, machine learning and conversational ui dots. This project is still on going and first BETA version is to be released in March 2018.</p>

<h3 class="project-title">This case study is still in preparation</h3>
<p class="text-left content-project">I am still working on this case study, the version you are reading will be completed in the next few weeks. I will briefly present below the steps we followed when designing this tool.</p>


<h3 class="project-title">Users and market research</h3>
<p class="text-left content-project">
The very first step of this project has been collecting information from similar products : their scope, strategy, UX... We quickly realized that most of the products were just online forms or HR software oriented to talent management with no real in-depth creativity features. 
Two types of users will be using mēkā : people wanting to assess their creativity in specific domains with the free version and hiring managers using mēkā pro in order to take the best decision. Based on this, we created two types of persona. 


</p>
<h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
     proto-persona, benchmarking. 


<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Matrix</h4>
<p class="text-left content-project">As an output from the persona profiles we created a matrix including the user needs, user goals, their constraints and assumptions. This helped us to define some key features and the feasibility of the project. 

    <h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
    Value Proposition, Description of the profitability model, metrics & growth perspectives (traffic). First technical effort estimation.

     


<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Steps of the user journey</h4>
<p class="text-left content-project">We defined and documented what would be the typical user journey for a candidate and a HR manager. We then turn these steps into wireframes.</p>
<h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
    User journey steps, wireframes.


<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Triggers for users</h4>
<p class="text-left content-project">At this point that we had a clear vision of what the product should be, I started to identify what kind of triggers would make the users willing to use meka : cool UI, powerful ai and gamification were the triggers I identified. Our product must be helpful, ease pain and provide pleasure. Doing this in the early steps of the project will help to align the features to be developed with the product long-term view. I try not to think too much about any technical constraint at that point, we will discuss the feasibility later on...</p>

<h3 class="project-title padding10_top">The benefits of conversational interface</h3>
<p class="text-left content-project">Most of the assessment test online are very looonnnng endless forms. In our case we needed at least 50 inputs in order to assess a profile. This would have meant that many users would have quickly drop the process... 

    <p class="text-left content-project">We needed to capture the information in a more engaging way.</p>

     <p class="text-left content-project">We therefore decided to go for the conversational approach. We first considered using a natural language chat approach, using and processing the text the user provides. It was not the right approach for two reasons : this is still a painful process for the user and the development cost for treating and process open inputs was too high. It was also error prone.  </p>
<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Our hybrid approach : capturing relevant information in a playful way</h4>

<p class="text-left content-project">We decided to implement an hybrid approach allowing us to capture information by following a conversational path already defined combining chat, voice with UI elements. There are many benefits to this approach : information is provided progressively under user´s command, the process can be stopped and saved at any time. It also provides one clear call to action for each test provided by the system. </p>

<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Getting better user engagement</h4>

<h5 class="project-title padding5_top">mēkā, the face of a product</h5>
<p class="text-left content-project">
This hybrid conversation interface approach allowed us to be more creative for a better man-machine interactions. We created our friendly character, mēkā. mēkā will be the face of our product. We wanted it to be playful, funny and easy going in order to immediately grab users' attention and become memorable to them. To do so I designed and animated mēkā using svg. For the BETA version I kept the interaction pretty simples but I am working on more complex interactions as I am convinced that quality interactions with mēkā will lead to quality engagement.
</p>
<h5 class="project-title padding5_top">Gamification</h5>
<p class="text-left content-project">
Gamification is another trigger I wanted to use for mēkā. Our product is also an educational product, we aim to help people embracing the creative mindset. Turning learning into a fun game improves engagement and retention. 
<h6 class="project-title padding5_top"> We love to complete things</h6>
<p class="text-left content-project">
The user is guided through completing their assessment in the most efficient way possible and progression is shown by the percent of test completeness.  For the future realeases I plan to introduce a slight "challenge" approach in order to keep users motivated. 
</p>

<h6 class="project-title padding5_top">The right quantity of friction</h6>
<p class="text-left content-project">
We know that people learn much more from failure than from success. A balanced level of friction is inherent to educational product and can also lead to more engagement if related to a test and not the overall product !
</p>

<h6 class="project-title padding5_top">Customization</h6>
<p class="text-left content-project">
Users expect individuality. We also decided to allocate development time for customization of their profiles and their own man-machine interaction. This will help our users to engage more with mēkā. 
</p>


<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Implementation costs</h4>

<p class="text-left content-project">
    Conversational Interface was also the cheapest option with regards of the team skillset. The front-end of the app is essentially designed in SVG. SVG is light and powerfull. I can therefore directly implement or test new ideas with less front-back interactions... Saving time and money with the app development allows us to invest more in AI training.
</p>


<h3 class="project-title padding10_top">Product strategy</h3>
<p class="text-left content-project">Afer having consolidated the information about our users, the market and the product it was time to discuss and plan what would be our strategy. Based on the inputs from the wireframes and drafts we created of the product I coded a prototype including what we identified as core features. I like to use code when deciding what will be the key features for a product. Seeing things in context is key. After a couple of iteration sessions with all the team we all meet in order to gather insights about the product goals. It helps prioritize features and define our key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs help inform design decisions along the way and measure results of the UX efforts. 
</p>
<h4 class="project-title padding5_top">Test version VS Pro Version</h4>

 <img class="" src="app/meka/images/meka_pro_sample.png" alt="meka pro dashboard" >
<p class="text-left content-project">mēkā will be free for users wanting to test and improve their creativity. In the meantime, the information provided by free users will train our AI. The pro version of mēkā (to be released later) will focus on company specific application process and professional dashboards for hiring manager. We will charge companies for using these features.</p>

<h6 class="project-title">Deliverables / Methods</h6>
Overall product strategy including long-term goals and KPI, Product roadmap including development effort

<h3 class="project-title padding10_top">Execution</h3>
<p class="text-left content-project">We are currently working on the development of the product. I decided to use the prototype I designed in the landing page and track every single interaction. meka will be domain specific (art/design, business, coding, musci and ... yes, cooking!). We will be using a common template for all combined with one specific test for each domain. The development of the specific test for each domain is resource consuming so we decided to check which domain most users wanted to train.
</p>
<h6 class="project-title">Launch</h6>
     <p class="text-left content-project">Hopefully in march 2018! Please visit mekacreative.io and spread the word!</p>
